##### A file for internal project notes about the codes
##### First created Nov 10, 2025 

**2025-11-12:**

* Created codes to simulate data using two different methods: sample() function and lavaan package (model-based).  
* Include code references. 
* Need to run initial analysis to test the data quality. 

**2025-11-16:**

* Updated and simplified the codes using sample() function by using `for` loop 

**2025-11-17:**

* Re-check the codes for simulating data using sample() function before submission
* Archived the codes using lavaan package (power analysis) after confirmed. Might go back and explore it more after this semester. 
* Keep in mind to keep things simple; there is not necessary to use codes exceeding the sample codes 

**2025-11-25:**

* Updated the codes for data simulation by reverse the data for soci_3 and soci_5, which aligns with the descriptions in the data dictionary. 

**2025-11-30:**

* Updated the codes for data simulation by reverse the variable names of "prob_left_skewed" and "prob_right_skewed" following instructor's feedback.
* "Left skew means that the tail pulls to the left, and so most of the distribution is over the right side." 
* Re-check the data generation output and rmd output
