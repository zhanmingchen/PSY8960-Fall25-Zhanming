```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Headers

`include = False` - Don't include in the output; it is actually default because we only want to show output in the manuscript.

`echo = False` - show the output but not the code

Gray areas are places for R scripts that will run

Mix text and functions all together: R trunks

`r nrow(dat)` - This is an R function specifically designed to determine the number of rows in a data structure. 

>```{r age}
>age_mean <- mean(dat$age)
>age_sd <- sd(dat$age)
>```

> inline translation: *M* age = `r round(age_sd, digits = 2)`

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Getting a summary of data (add detailed and heavy comments)
summary(cars)
```

```{r sample text, include=FALSE}
table(cars$speed)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
