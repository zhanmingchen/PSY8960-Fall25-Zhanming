  Personality traits have been shown to be related to many aspects of life. But what about scientific reasoning? We don't really know how these are related. The current study consists of an analysis of 199 U.S. college students enrolled in STEM majors who completed measures of personality traits and scientific reasoning. The results indicated a lot of variability in scientific reasoning.

As one of the emerging forms of advertising, interactive advertising adds features to traditional advertising that allow consumers to interact with and participate in the advertisements [@bezjian-avery1998]. These interactive features provided active control, two‑way communication, and a sense of reacting synchronically for the audience during the interaction process [@liu2002; @lombard2001; @mcmillan2002]. Traditional advertising, such as static image advertisements in shopping malls, provided a one-way channel to deliver marketing information to the audience in a controlled, linear narrative structure. Compared to traditional advertising, interactive advertising has proven to be advantageous in increasing both consumers’ attitudes and purchase intention [@macias2003] and further enhancing the overall marketing performance [@gu2022]. An example of interactive advertising was the 2015 augmented-reality-based advertisement launched by Coca-Cola in the United States, titled “Next time you’re thirsty, drink an ad” [@dipdropbrandingsolution2015]. During basketball matches, audiences could enjoy a visual experience of a smooth transition from television to mobile devices, as they watched the pouring of Coke Zero from a bottle on the TV screen into a glass in the mobile application. Coca-Cola then offered a coupon code that could be redeemed for a bottle of Coke Zero [@thecoca-colacompany2015].

While previous research on interactive advertising focused on its effects on consumption behaviors (e.g., [@ahn2024]) , the impact of interactive advertising on donation intentions and behaviors has been limitedly explored. In this study, we aim to understand how interactive advertisements influence donation attitudes and behaviors. Therefore, our research question is: how does the level of advertising interactivity affect the audience’s donation intentions?

## The Present Study

Research has shown that the interactive design features of advertisements (e.g., buttons and body gestures) contribute to higher levels of purchase intention [@ahn2024a; @gu2022a]. At the same time, the perceived interactivity of visual materials can positively influence the audience’s emotions, such as perceived playfulness, levels of empathy, and social presence [@kang2020; @hand2009; @ide2021]. Furthermore, the audience’s positive emotions, including perceived playfulness, sympathy, and social presence, were separately examined and shown to affect their perceptions related to efficacy and behavioral intentions [@chen2019; @kim2015]. Additionally, researchers identified perceived response efficacy, a belief that consumers’ help can make a meaningful difference for the beneficiaries [@sharma2016; @septianto2021], as an important factor explaining donation behaviors.

Building on the prior research, we propose the following five hypotheses (H1–H5):

-   H1. Perceived interactivity of advertisements will be positively related to (a) perceived playfulness, (b) level of empathy, and (c) social presence.
-   H2. Perceived playfulness will be positively related to (a) perceived response efficacy and (b) donation intention.
-   H3. Level of empathy will be positively related to (a) perceived response efficacy and (b) donation intention.
-   H4. Social presence will be positively related to (a) perceived response efficacy and (b) donation intention.
-   H5. Perceived efficacy will be positively related to donation intention.

# Method

The current study was **NOT** preregistered. Data and code are available at <https://github.com/syeducation/traits-reasoning>. You can also access the data and code [by clicking on this text here](https://github.com/syeducation/traits-reasoning).

## Participants and Procedure

```{r demographics, include=FALSE}

# create objects for mean and sd of age, to be inserted in text

age_mean <- mean(dat$age)
age_sd <- sd(dat$age)

# recode usborn factors from (1, 2) to (born outside U.S., born inside U.S.)

dat <- mutate(dat, usborn = factor(usborn, levels = c(1,2),
                                   labels = c("Not Born in U.S.", "Born in U.S.")))
summarytools::freq(dat$usborn)

# now creating object for percent born in U.S., to include in descriptives

usborn_percent <- (nrow(filter(dat, usborn == "Born in U.S."))/(nrow(dat)) * 100)

```

The total sample in the current study consists of `r nrow(dat)` students enrolled in one of the three STEM-focused colleges at a large public university in the U.S. Midwest (*M* age = `r round(age_mean, digits = 2)`, *SD* = `r round(age_sd, digits = 2)`). Most of the participants (`r round(usborn_percent, digits = 2)`%) were born in the U.S.

Participants were recruited from a list of all first-year students in the three colleges who identified as racial/ethnic minorities. Eligible students were sent a survey link via email and compensated \$25 for their participation.

## Measures

### Personality Traits.

Participants completed the 100-item Big Five Aspect Scale (DeYoung et al., 2007), which assesses the big five traits as well as ten aspects. We collected these, but we aren't using them in the current study (despite the title of the project).

### Scientific Reasoning.

```{r scientific reasoning, include=FALSE}

```

Participants completed an 11-item assessment of scientific reasoning (Drummond & Fischhoff, 2017), in which they were asked to read a description of a scientific activity and then answer True or False to a question about that activity (Cronbach's alpha = `r round(srs_alpha, digits = 2)`).

## Data analysis

We used `r cite_r("r-references.bib")` for all our analyses.

# Results

Overall, participant did well on the scientific reasoning task, averaging more correct than incorrect answers, *M* correct = `r round(srs_mean, digits = 2)`, (*SD* = `r round(srs_sd, digits = 2)`). However, these results are best examined via tables and figures, so let's look at some.

Here is a table of each item and its rate of success:

```{r descriptive table, echo=FALSE}

# this code creates a table, in which you almost literally "create" the table with the code
# that is, the first row (with the ~) serves as the column headers
# then the following entries indicate what should go in each cell. 

srs_table <- dplyr::tribble(
    ~Item, ~Mean, ~SD,
    "SRS Item 1", srs_1_mean,  srs_1_sd,
    "SRS Item 2", srs_2_mean,  srs_2_sd,
    "SRS Item 3", srs_3_mean,  srs_3_sd,
    "SRS Item 4", srs_4_mean,  srs_4_sd,
    "SRS Item 5", srs_5_mean,  srs_5_sd,
    "SRS Item 6", srs_6_mean,  srs_6_sd,
    "SRS Item 7", srs_7_mean,  srs_7_sd,
    "SRS Item 8", srs_8_mean,  srs_8_sd,
    "SRS Item 9", srs_9_mean,  srs_9_sd,
    "SRS Item 10", srs_10_mean,  srs_10_sd,
    "SRS Item 11", srs_11_mean,  srs_11_sd)

# now we can use the built in APA table function to format that table

apa_table(srs_table, 
             caption = "Descriptives for SRS scale",
             align = "l", digits = 2,
          note = "This is a table")

```

It looks like item 11 was the most difficult:

> `r var_label(dat$srs_11_scored)`

On average, people did pretty well, but from the standard deviation for the scale as well as the means and standard deviations of the individual items you can see there is quite a bit of variability. It is always important to plot your data, so let's take a look at the distribution!

```{r histogram, echo=FALSE}

# basic histogram code using ggplot. 
# remember for quick and dirty checks you can use the base r hist() function

ggplot(dat, aes(srs)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .10, fill = "green", color = "black") +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Scientific Reasoning Scores",
       x = "% Correct",
       y = "Frequency (Count)")

```

*Figure 1*. Histogram of scientific reasoning scale.

That's nice, but perhaps a density plot, separately for those born in the U.S. and those not.

```{r usborn density}

ggplot(dat, aes(x = srs, fill = usborn)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.75) + 
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Scientific Reasoning (Mean)") + 
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Immigrant Status") +
  theme_classic()

```

*Figure 2*. Density plot of scientific reasoning by immigrant status.

```{r usborn t-test, echo=FALSE}

# comparing u.s. born and not u.s. born on scientific reasoning

t_test_usborn <- t.test(dat$srs ~ dat$usborn)

# save out all necessary objects

t_usborn <- t_test_usborn$statistic
df_usborn <- t_test_usborn$parameter
p_usborn <- t_test_usborn$p.value

```

Next we examined whether immigrant status was related to difference in scientific reasoning. Results from a Welch's independent samples *t*-test indicated no significant differences between the two groups, *t*(`r df_usborn`) = `r t_usborn`, *p* = `r p_usborn`. See Table 2 for means and standard deviations by group.

```{r usborn table, echo=FALSE}

usborn_srs_means <- dat %>% dplyr::group_by(usborn) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(Mean = mean(srs,  na.rm = TRUE), 
            SD = sd(srs,  na.rm = TRUE))


apa_table(usborn_srs_means, 
          caption = "Descriptives Statistics for SRS scale by Immigrant Status",
          col.names = c("Immigrant Status", "Mean", "SD"),
          align = "l", digits = 2,
          note = "The groups did not statistically differ")

```

Tables are great and all, but it is also nice to see the data in a figure. Here is one:

```{r usborn figure, echo=FALSE}

# creating a nice violin plot

ggplot(dat, aes(x = usborn, y = srs)) +
  geom_violin(color = "black", fill = "green", alpha = .25) +
  geom_boxplot(width = .4, fill = "green") +
  geom_jitter(height = .05, width = .1, size = .90) +
  scale_x_discrete(name = "Immigrant Status") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Scientific Reasoning (Mean)") +
  theme_classic()

```

*Figure 3*. A beautiful display of data

# Discussion

The purpose of the present study was to examine how personality traits are related to scientific reasoning. Overall, it seems that people reason about science, but maybe not as much as we would have hope.We don't actually know how personality traits are related to scientific reasoning, because we did not assess that. That is a limitation of the study that should guide future work.

In sum, this was a very mediocre study. We will try better in the future.
